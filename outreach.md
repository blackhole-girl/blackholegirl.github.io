I take part of various outreach schemes, listed below are some of them:

- Native Scientist (Science workshops for Arabic-Speaking refugees)
- Piscopia Initiative (Local committee at Newcastle)
- Audio Universe (Workshops for school visits)

I also regularly give outreach talks on supermassive black holes to kids visiting Newcastle University (lead by Success4All Charity).
