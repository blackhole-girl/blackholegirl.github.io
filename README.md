   Hi There, Houda Here :-).

  I am a PhD research at Newcastle Univeristy, where I study supermassive blackholes. I've completed my Masters at Observatoire de Paris in France and my Bachelors at Queen Mary Univeristy of London. 
  
  My research interests lie within the field of galaxy formation and evolution. More specifically, I am interested in understanding how supermassive black holes form, grow and evolve in symbiosis with    their host galaxies. My PhD project   focuses on understanding the interplay between AGN and their host galaxies using novel data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
  
  Born and raised in Morocco, becoming an astrophysicist was a dream and challenge I was committed to against all odds. Today, as an astrophysicist, I hope to help under-represented people to pursue     an education in STEM. In my free time, I enjoy creating digital arts and cooking delicious plant-based meals.
